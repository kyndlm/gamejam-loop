4. Challenges & Lessons Learned

This game jam presented several exciting challenges:

	•	Time Constraints: Working within tight deadlines pushed us to prioritize essential features and make quick decisions.
 
	•	Team Collaboration with Git: It was our first experience using Git extensively in a team setting, teaching us valuable lessons about version control, branching, and resolving merge conflicts.
 
	•	Learning Godot and GDScript: This project marked our first time using Godot and GDScript. Despite the initial learning curve, we adapted quickly to the engine’s workflow, gaining confidence in this new development environment.

5. Future Improvements

If we revisit this project, we would like to implement the following features:

	•	Enhanced AI for enemies
	•	More diverse levels and environments
	•	Boss scenario
	•	Additional player abilities and items
	•	Minimap for easier navigation
